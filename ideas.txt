Controls:
    - Not full analog on the joystick.  Just two stages

Health Mechanic:
    - Idea 1: Far Cry health system. 4 stages of healthbar
      can only recover to the current stage of health

Death Mechanic:
    - You only have one life for each character by default
    - if you die, then you can't replay that character until they
      recharge
    - Maybe have it so that everytime you beat a story, or some
      other challenge, that they get an extra life. Or zero/one recharge
      means they can start a new story, but two recharges means that they
      can continue

Story ideas:
    - Get enough money.
    - Get to a certain level without taking too much damage
    - Fall down enough holes
    - Get to a certain level fast enough
    - Get to a certain level with out killing anything
    - Break enough torches
    - Each character has a different default story
